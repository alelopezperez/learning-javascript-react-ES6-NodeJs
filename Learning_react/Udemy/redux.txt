Redux Thunk
- Middleware to us make request in a redux app	

	General Data Loading Redux
		- Compoenet gets rendered on screen
		- IN CLASS use componenetDidMount gets called
			- We call action creator from componentDidMount
		- Action creator runs code to make API request
		- API responds with data
		- Action cretor return an action with the fetched data on the payload property
		- Some Reducer sees the action return the data off the payload
		- Becaue we generated some new state objet, react redux make the app re-render
		
Action Creator should only return a plain JS Object
- The prblem is both calling it a async
