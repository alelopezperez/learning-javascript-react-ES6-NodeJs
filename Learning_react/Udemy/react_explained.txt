React Notes
-a react compenten can be a class or a functional(yay Functional Programming)
JSX Project
-src
	- Only index.js
		import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
			reacdom can be any name
			
JSX vs HTML
	-adding custom styling is with different styling
		- you nee to add {{ }} two curly brace
			-the first { javascript var
			- the second { is fot js object that i learned in freecodecamp
				- this are the properties
				- i learned that
		- any styling uses cammelCase convention
		-also no ""
		-so props goes like this
			-border : '1px solid red'
			-because props is a var or a primitive
			- in this case we use strings
	-class in html is different in jsx
		-instead of class use className
		-because class is already taken in js
	- You can reference js variable in jsx
		-with {}
		
		- Limitations:
			-with objects you need to use the key
			-you cant show the whole obj as a html attribute
			
JSX this is just a convention
	- all string are in double quotes
	- non jsx use single quotes

Creating Reusable Configurable Component
- Indetify the replicate jsx
- create a name
- create a new file for the component
- In the new file create the new component by copy pasting	


React Props
- Passing data from parent component to child component
- Customize or configure the child
- you cannot pass data from child to parent

to pass down property from the parent:
<Compenent propname = {var} />
<Compenent propname = literal />

in the component the first arguments are the props
const Component = (props) => {}
