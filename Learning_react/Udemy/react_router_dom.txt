The Normal syntax is
<BrowserRouter>
	<Route path:'/' exact componenet={components_name}/>
	<Route path:'/second' componenet={components_name} />
</BrowserRrouter>

without the exact keyword the react-router will stop when it finds the path in the url, if it has exact it will do a complete match up

React Router start reading the path with the first '/' and on

<BrowserRouter> has an history object and passes the path to the BroswerRouter
 and passes it along the router compoenents
 
 if a route it's duplicated it will render both on screen one after the other
	- it depends on the order of how you wrote the down
	
<Route exact={true}/> it's the same as <Route exact/>

PAth Matching '/pageTwo/5'
	it has '/' '/pagetwo' and '/pagetwo/5'
	- It goes from left two right addin
	
Navigation
	- Do NOT use anchot tag <a href='/pagetwo'></a>
		- Your Broswe makes a request to localhost
		- Developt server responds with the intial html again
		- Broswe gets index.html dump old html (all local varible dumped like react/redux state)
		- index.html load js files, and goes from initial to browser route
		- our app starts up
		- use Link from react-router-dom
			-use the link tag as you would an anchor tag

Browser Router -> localhost:300/pagetwo -> Uses everith after the TLD(top level domain) .com or.net or port as path
HashRouter -> localhost:3000/#/pagetwo -> uses everythi after a # as the path -> changes to a # only one
MemoryRouter -> localhost:3000/ -> Does use the url to track navaigation goin back does not work

CreateaREactServer
	- Dev Resources it will try to looke for literal file in the path of the server
	- Check public directory and check those file
	- If not the give the index.html
	
Putting the header inside the BrosweRouter does no re-render an static component
