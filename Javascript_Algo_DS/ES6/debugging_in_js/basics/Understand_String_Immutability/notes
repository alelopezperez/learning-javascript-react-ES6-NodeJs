Strings in Javascript are Immutable;
That means that you can only change the whole value in JavaScript like
var st = "Hola"
st = "Adios"

but you cannot 

st[0] = 'C' // this is wrong you cannot do it.. this inmutability is only in Javascript; because in rust you cannot change the value of a immutable variable
///he individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed.
